        n computing, a program is a specific set of ordered operations for a computer to perform. In the modern computer
        that John von Neumann outlined in 1945, the program contains a one-at-a-time sequence of instructions that the
        computer follows. Typically, the program is put into a storage area accessible to the computer. The computer
        gets one instruction and performs it and then gets the next instruction. The storage area or memory can also
        contain the data that the instruction operates on. Note that a program is also a special kind of data that
        indicates how to operate on application or user data.

    <p>
        When you create a program, you write it using some kind of computer language. Your language statements are the
        source program. You then compile the source program with a special program called a language compiler, and the
        result is called an object program -- not to be confused with object-oriented programming. There are several
        synonyms for object program, including object module and compiled program. The object program contains the
        string of 0s and 1s called machine language that the logic processor works with.
